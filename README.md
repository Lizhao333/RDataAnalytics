# Space Analytics: O-Rings Failure Analysis (R Project)

### Project Overview

This is one of my data analytics projects in R, focusing on **space analytics**.  
Specifically, this project investigates the **Challenger Space Shuttle disaster** using the **O-Rings dataset**. The goal is to explore the relationship between **launch temperature** and **O-ring failure incidents** through **data analysis** and **regression modeling**.
In the R script, you will find annnotation of the code and its explanation of my thought process.

###  Objective

- Investigate whether lower temperatures increased the risk of O-ring damage.
- Apply **linear** and **logistic regression** to model this relationship.
- Use **data visualization** to support conclusions.

### Tools & Methods

- Language: `R`
- Packages: 'ROCR'
- Techniques:
  - Data cleaning & EDA
  - Scatter plots
  - Linear regression
  - Logistic regression
  - Model interpretation
